A undergraduate natural language processing (NLP) project to identify various aspects and drivers of depression.

<h3> Summary </h3> 
The onset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) has enabled the advancement of autonomous vehicles in recent years. Major corporations such as Baidu, Cruise and Tesla have been at the forefront of commercializing autonomous vehicles (AV) as epitomized by Baidu’s plan to roll out 1,000 Baidu Apollo robotaxis by 2024 (Kharpal, 2021).

Just recently, Tesla released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software for drivers with high safety scores, even though it was still in Beta phase. The software allows a Tesla to automatically switch lanes, shift into a parking spot and navigate on a highway without a driver controlling the vehicle (Kolodny, 2021). This is a huge shift from the current Level 2 anonymity, which still requires a human driver behind the wheel (NHTSA, n.d.).
With these rapid technological advancements in the AV industry, there are mixed sentiments and controversies regarding the interest level of the public in autonomous vehicles, citing safety as the main concern for the adoption of autonomous vehicles (Hassol et al., 2019).
Hence, as public sentiment is the key to acceptance of new technologies, how can we predict overall public sentiment to support the rapid advancements of new driverless technology?
